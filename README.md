Biological databases have emerged in response to the need for storing and analyzing the big data generated by High-throughput technologies.

The Human Genome Project (1990-2003) was the promoter for the development of technologies capable of producing large biological datasets and the field of bioinformatics evolved to become closely integrated with such technologies.

The volume of data for researchers involved in life sciences can double every six months.
This rate of growth exceed Mooreâ€™s law, which predicts that capacity doubles every eighteen months.
